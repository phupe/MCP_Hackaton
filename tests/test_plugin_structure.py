"""Drift guards for a three-ecosystem plugin tree. CLI and pytest in one file.

    python3 check_plugin.py --root <repo>      # exit 1 and one line per problem
    cp check_plugin.py <repo>/tests/test_plugin_structure.py   # pytest collects test_*

The checks are the invariants no loader verifies for you, distilled from
colgrep-mcp's `test_manifests.py`, `test_dev_plugin.py` and `test_hooks.py`
(references/manifests.md, references/hooks.md). Each one exists because
breaking it produced a silent failure once: a server that never started, a
hook that never fired, a version that lagged behind a release.

Stdlib only, Python >= 3.9. When copied into a test suite, set REPO_ROOT to
the repository root (the default walks up from this file until it finds a
`.claude-plugin/` or `plugin.json`).

A repo may hold more than one plugin (a multi-plugin spec's siblings, or a
maintainer `dev/` plugin next to the product): `collect_problems` scans for
every plugin root under `--root` and checks each independently, so one
sibling's identity (name, version) is never compared against another's.
Codex has no manifest of its own since it reads the shared root
`plugin.json`, taking its extras from `extensions["com.openai"]`.
"""

# NOTE: this file is a copy of the spawning-agent-plugins skill's
# scripts/check_plugin.py (see plugin.spec.json at the repo root). Two local
# deviations from the skill's own copy:
#
# 1. The MCP-section placeholder check below tolerates exactly one root
# placeholder per ecosystem inside `args` -- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` in
# `.claude-plugin/mcp.json` and `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` in `mcp.json` -- because
# these five demo servers are unpublished, repo-local scripts
# (`plugins/<name>/*_server.py`, no PyPI package) that must be launched from
# the plugin's own directory instead of a pinned published artifact. Any
# other `$` in `args`, and `$` in `command` or in the non-Claude `env`, are
# still forbidden exactly as in the skill's copy. The per-ecosystem launch
# comparison normalises both placeholder spellings to a common
# `<PLUGIN_ROOT>` marker before comparing launches, so this one tolerated
# deviation does not by itself trip the "launched differently per ecosystem"
# check.
#
# 2. `AGENT_PLUGIN_SCHEMA_REQUIRED` (below) is False: the six root
# plugin.json files under plugins/demo-*/ deliberately omit the Agent
# Plugins 1.0 `$schema` key, because VS Code 1.138.0 / Copilot Chat 0.66.0
# routes any plugin.json carrying it to a loader that never substitutes
# `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` nor sets a working directory, so the servers cannot start
# there (microsoft/vscode#303219, #305310). The "plugin.json needs the
# agent-plugins.org $schema" check is gated on that constant, and the
# mcp.json/plugin.json schema-version comparison skips when plugin.json has
# no `$schema`, so this repo does not fail its own structural check while
# the omission is in effect.
#
# The pytest entry point at the bottom also tries `--spec plugin.spec.json`
# but falls back to no spec on ImportError: `_check_declared_plugins_complete`
# / `_dev_pairs_from_spec` lazily `from spawn_plugin import ...` out of the
# checker's own directory, and this copy carries only check_plugin.py, not
# its sibling spawn_plugin.py. This repo has no `dev/` plugins to validate
# against a spec anyway, so the fallback loses no real coverage here.
#
# Keep everything else in this file in sync with the skill's own copy at
# .claude/plugins/cache/cracking-shells/spawning-agent-plugins/*/skills/
# spawning-agent-plugins/scripts/check_plugin.py.

    (e.g. an assembled `plugins/<name>/` tree, or two independently-versioned siblings
    both living under a repo-root product) as it is that root's dev plugin. Structural
    inference conflates "nested under a root" with "IS the dev plugin of that root",
    which tree shape alone cannot separate.

    So `dev_pairs` — built by `_dev_pairs_from_spec` from the spec's own `dev`

    `None` (no `--spec` given) intentionally runs NONE of those checks; there is no

    caused the false positive this replaced. That absence is advisory, not a defect in
    the tree being checked — `--spec` is optional, so omitting it cannot be a hard
    failure — so it goes to `notes`, never `problems`: a hub-mode repo has no other way
    to skip dev validation than by omitting `--spec`, and counting that omission as a
    problem would fail every hub-mode root for want of a flag. What DOES still run
    without a spec is the marketplace-entry dangling-reference check below, since it
    never needs to classify dev vs. product at all — a source `find_plugin_roots` never
